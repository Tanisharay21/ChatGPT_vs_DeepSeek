Compare ChatGPT and DeepSeek on user engagement, response quality, and satisfaction to uncover actionable AI insights.

# ChatGPT vs DeepSeek: AI Platform Performance Analysis

##  Project Overview
This project analyzes and compares the real-world performance of **ChatGPT** and **DeepSeek** using 10,000 user interaction sessions.  
The goal is to understand **how effectively AI helps users** across different query types, devices, languages, and engagement patterns.  
Analysis was done in Python (pandas), focusing on actionable, business-relevant insights.

---

##  Objectives
- Compare overall platform performance between ChatGPT and DeepSeek  
- Identify which types of tasks AI performs best at  
- Understand user engagement beyond surface-level metrics  
- Test assumptions about language, device, and session length  
- Translate technical metrics into **clear business insights**

---

# Key Insights

## Platform Performance: Quality Over Loyalty
DeepSeek delivers **faster responses, higher accuracy, and higher user ratings** than ChatGPT, while retention rates remain similar across platforms.  
**Takeaway:** Users respond to performance quality, not platform familiarity.

---

## Where AI Delivers the Most Value
AI excels in **technical tasks** like algorithm explanations, debugging, and code optimization — high ratings align with fewer corrections.  
Creative and educational tasks show lower accuracy but stable satisfaction, highlighting the value of **guidance over perfection**.

---

## Technical vs General Queries
DeepSeek shines in **technical queries**, combining high satisfaction with low corrections.  
For general queries, users still rate responses highly but make more edits, reflecting refinement rather than errors.  

**Takeaway:** Corrections do not always indicate failure; they often reflect collaborative usage.

---

## Engagement Reality Check
Session duration and response length have almost no correlation. Many long sessions involve **reading, thinking, or iterating**, not just consuming output.  

**Takeaway:** Time spent is a weak metric; focus on **outcome quality** instead.

---

## Language Performance
AI effectiveness is consistent across **English, German, French, Spanish, and Chinese**.  
No language provides a meaningful advantage.

**Takeaway:** Query structure matters more than language, lowering barriers to global adoption.

---

## Learnings
- DeepSeek is faster and more accurate, especially for technical workflows  
- ChatGPT performs well for general and conversational use  
- High correction rates can indicate collaboration, not failure  
- Session length is a weak proxy for satisfaction  
- AI performance is largely **language- and device-neutral**

---

## Tools Used
- Python (pandas, numpy)  
- Feature Engineering & EDA  
- Business-Oriented Insight Framing  

---

## Summary
This project highlights **decision-focused analytics**: not just what the AI does, but how and why it impacts users.  
It provides actionable insights for **product teams**, helping guide smarter AI adoption and improvement strategies.
